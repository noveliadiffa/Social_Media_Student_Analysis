## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of social media usage on student behavior and well-being, using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for interactive visualization.
The dataset includes student demographics, daily usage patterns, platform preferences, and mental health indicators.

## Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL) – for data querying and analysis
- Tableau Public – for dashboard creation and visualization

## Key Insights
